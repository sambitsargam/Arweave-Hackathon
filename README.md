# I PAUSED THE BACKEND


## Inspiration

The inspiration behind ArTrackrHub stems from the need to provide users with a comprehensive and efficient solution for tracking their Arweave blockchain transactions. With the growing popularity of blockchain technology and the Arweave network, users require a reliable way to stay informed about their on-chain activities.


## What it does

ArTrackrHub is a powerful web service that offers on-chain transaction notifications and data upload capabilities on the Arweave blockchain. Users can subscribe to their wallet addresses and receive real-time updates whenever transactions occur, making it valuable for traders and developers. The service ensures privacy and security by not storing sensitive wallet information and encrypting data exchanges. Additionally, ArTrackrHub allows users to seamlessly upload data to Arweave for permanent and decentralized storage, catering to various applications from content archiving to blockchain enthusiasts seeking to monitor their activities. Moreover, you can fetch the transactions of ArNS registered names, enhancing your ability to track and manage your digital assets efficiently.

## How it works

ArTrackrHub operates through a multi-layered backend system that enables smooth transaction tracking and email notifications. When users enter their wallet addresses and email subscriptions through the intuitive frontend interface, this information is securely stored in a backend database. The backend then employs cron jobs to continuously fetch transactions associated with subscribed wallet addresses using Arweave's GraphQL API. These fetched transactions are processed by another backend system, which utilizes the nodemailer library to send personalized email notifications to subscribed users. This intricate workflow ensures that users receive timely and accurate transaction updates, enhancing their overall blockchain experience.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the challenges we encountered was ensuring the security of user data while providing real-time transaction updates. We had to design a robust backend architecture that efficiently fetched and processed transactions without compromising user privacy. Additionally, synchronizing the various backend components to ensure seamless email delivery required careful coordination.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have developed a fully functional web service that addresses the need for on-chain transaction notifications on the Arweave blockchain. Our solution seamlessly combines frontend and backend technologies to provide users with a user-friendly experience while maintaining data security and privacy.

## What we learned

Through building ArTrackrHub, we gained valuable experience in integrating frontend and backend systems to provide real-time updates. We also deepened our understanding of Arweave's GraphQL API and learned how to efficiently fetch and process blockchain transactions.

## What's next for ArTrackrHub

In the future, we aim to enhance ArTrackrHub's features by incorporating more advanced notification customization options for users. We also plan to explore partnerships with decentralized applications (DApps) to provide seamless integration with their platforms. Additionally, we will continue to refine the user interface and optimize the backend systems for even smoother transaction tracking and email delivery.
